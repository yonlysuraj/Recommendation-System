# Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies based on content similarity. It analyzes metadata from a dataset of movies and provides recommendations using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning techniques**.

## 🛠 Features
- **Content-based filtering** using movie metadata
- **Machine Learning (ML) techniques** for similarity computation
- **Interactive & Scalable** for deployment in a web application

## 📂 Project Structure
```
├── recommendation-system.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook for model development
├── tmdb_5000_credits.csv        # Movie credits dataset
├── tmdb_5000_movies.csv         # Movie metadata dataset
├── requirements.txt             # List of dependencies
├── README.md                    # Project documentation
```

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook
If you want to test the recommendation system in a Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open `recommendation-system.ipynb` and run the cells.

## 🏗 How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Extracts relevant features like genre, cast, and overview.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Count Vectorizer** for text analysis.
3. **Similarity Computation**: Computes movie similarity using **Cosine Similarity**.
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Finds the most similar movies for a given input.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add a **Flask or FastAPI** web interface
- Improve recommendation accuracy with **Deep Learning**
- Include **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**
